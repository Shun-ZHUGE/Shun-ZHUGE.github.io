This paper proposes a novel geometric solution for tracking a moving target through multistatic sensing. In contrast to existing two-step weighted least square (2SWLS) methods which use the bistatic range (BR) and bistatic range rate (BRR) measurements, the proposed method incorporates an additional direction of arrival (DOA) measurement of the target obtained from a communication receiver in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Unlike the existing 2SWLS methods that require at least three transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) pairs to operate, the proposed algorithm can conduct location estimation with a single TX-RX pair and velocity estimation with two TX-RX pairs. Simulations reveal that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to existing 2SWLS methods, particularly when dealing with moderate levels of noise in DOA measurements.
