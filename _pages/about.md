I am Shun Zhuge, a Ph.D. Candidate in the Embedded Systems ([ES](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems)) group within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science ([EEMCS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs)) at the Delft University of Technology ([TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/)), supervised by [Prof. Qing Wang](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/). My Ph.D. position is part of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network, specifically within [6thSense](https://dn6sense.eu/) project, which focuses on Joint Communication and Sensing in 6G Networks. 

Before relocating to the Netherlands, I completed my Master of Science in Communications Engineering at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiping Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/ezplin/). During my time in Singapore, I was affiliated with the Institute for Infocomm Research ([I2R](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r)) at the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), where I was supervised by [Dr. Yonghong Zeng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonghong-zeng-0870b63b/?originalSubdomain=sg) (IEEE Fellow) and [Dr. Yugang Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yugang-ma-390b0363/?originalSubdomain=sg). I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electronic and Communication Systems, with a minor in Finance, from the Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)), earned in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Nan Yang](https://eng.anu.edu.au/people/nan-yang/).

Research Interests
------
My current research interests lie at the intersection of Joint Sensing and Communication (JCAS) and Tiny Machine Learning (Tiny-ML). I am passionate about contributing to the advancement of next-generation wireless communication systems.
