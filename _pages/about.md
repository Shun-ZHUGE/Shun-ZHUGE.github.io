I am Shun Zhuge, a Ph.D. Candidate in the Embedded Systems ([ES](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems)) group of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science ([EEMCS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs)) at the Delft University of Technology ([TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/)), supervised by [Prof. Qing Wang](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/). This Ph.D. position is in Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Network Joint Communication and Sensing in 6G Networks ([6th Sense](https://dn6sense.eu/)). 

Before moving to the Netherlands, I earned my Master of Science in Communications Engineering from Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Zhiping Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/ezplin/). I was affiliated with the Institute for Infocomm Research ([I2R](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r)), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), Singapore, supervised by [Dr. Yonghong Zeng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonghong-zeng-0870b63b/?originalSubdomain=sg) (IEEE Fellow) and [Dr. Yugang Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yugang-ma-390b0363/?originalSubdomain=sg). I also earned a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electronic and Communication Systems from the Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)) in 2022, with a minor in Finance, supervised by [Prof. Nan Yang](https://eng.anu.edu.au/people/nan-yang/).


Research Interests
------
My current research interests lie at the intersection of Joint Sensing and Communication (JCAS), and Tiny Machine Learning (Tiny-ML). I am passionate about contributing to the advancement of next-generation wireless communication systems.
